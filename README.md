I'm some guy on the internet who writes wacky words in a coloured text editor by day and stares at deployments at night. Apparently I'm a full-stack software engineer with main focus on DevOps, infrastructure and security. Some say I'm an [awesome.engineer](https://awesome.engineer) (paid a pretty penny for that domain name so get to not use it ðŸ™ˆ)

Want to stalk my activity online? I'm giving you the following methods:
